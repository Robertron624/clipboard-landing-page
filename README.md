## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project I leveled up my layout skills and used semantic HTML to divide each section of the page's body. I also used CSS Grid and
flexbox to create a responsive layout that looks good on all screen sizes. I also used the :hover selector to change the background color and colors of the buttons and links.
### Continued development

I want to work in more complex projects to improve my skills and learn new things in terms of layouts. I also want to learn more about CSS animations and transitions to make my projects more interactive and fun to use.
